# Blickr

# Blickr is a wifi-less and phone-less system that allows for one way information transfer using Bluetooth Low Energy. Planning to make it a kahoot-like application to be used in less developed countries to allow for a more interactive classroom with more exposure to technology for the students without internet connection and devices.

# Successfully tested out using ESP32, multiple ESP32 devices could send information to the local server at lightning speeds at the same time. The backend could recognise what message came from which device by parsing and procesing each string sent.
