## About The Project
<div align="center">

Built with Flask. I programmed an ESP32 attached with buttons and a screen to act as a clicker. The local server receives these strings of characters from these devices and sorts and processes them. One server can display inputs from over 4 separate devices and discern which input came from which clicker.
